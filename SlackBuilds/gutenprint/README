Gutenprint (formerly named Gimp-Print) is a suite of printer drivers
that may be used with most common print spooling systems, including
CUPS, LPRng, or others.  These drivers provide high quality printing
in many cases equal to or better than proprietary vendor-supplied
drivers.  Gutenprint also includes an enhanced print plug-in for the
GIMP image editor.
