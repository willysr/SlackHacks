netatalk (Appletalk file and print server)

Netatalk is an Appletalk file and print server for Linux.  Using 
Netatalk, Macintosh computers on your local network can mount Linux 
volumes as if they were standard Appletalk network drives, and can
print to the Linux box's printer as if it were a network printer
supporting PostScript.

Netatalk was originally written by the Research Systems Unix Group at
The University of Michigan, and is maintained by the Netatalk Team.
