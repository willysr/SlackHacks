The Common UNIX Printing System provides a portable printing layer for
UNIX(R)-like operating systems. It has been developed by Easy Software
Products to promote a standard printing solution for all UNIX vendors
and users.  CUPS uses the Internet Printing Protocol ("IPP") as the
basis for managing print jobs and queues.  The CUPS package includes
System V and Berkeley command-line interfaces, a PostScript RIP
package for supporting non-PostScript printer drivers, and tools for
creating additional printer drivers and other CUPS services.

Since Apple has discontinued some backends and filters, they are moved
to cups-filters which are now maintained by OpenPrinting
